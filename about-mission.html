        <p>The vast majority of churches have less than 100 members. In most cases, these churches have neither the time, personnel or resources to have a great website. Most church websites solutions out there charge an expensive set-up fee and <em>then</em> $30-$50 a month.</p>

        <p>We know from experience, $1,500 a year for a church website just isn’t doable for a small church.</p>

        <p>Even if it was, most churches don’t have the time, knowledge or graphic design skills to KEEP a church website great after initial handoff. Want proof of this? Do a random sampling of church websites and you’ll find that in most cases, they haven’t been updated in months if not years.</p>

        <p>We are out to fix this.</p>

        <p>Simply put: <strong>We want to provide websites that are both easy to update and inexpensive so that any church can have a great website.</strong></p>

        <p>Our second goal may seem strange: we want to <strong>provide jobs</strong> to would-be pastors, bible college students and people just starting out in the ministry that they can do on their own time to <strong>help support their mission and their families</strong>. Each sitesfor.church website is assigned a “site-rep” - a real, honest-to-goodness human being (who lives in the same hemisphere as you) who will help your church set-up and customize your website and who will serve as your primary support contact.</p>

        <p><em>Think back to when you were a student</em> (or just starting out) - would you have liked to have a side job that fit with your mission in life (helping churches) that you could do on your own time and that paid well? Of course you would.</p>

        <p>Using site-reps like this not only gives you a better, more personal experience it also helps real people who are trying to serve God with their life.</p>

        <h1>Revolutionize church websites</h1>

    <div class="text">
        <p>We have big goals. We want to become the go-to company for church websites. We know what we have right now isn’t for everyone. But we are pushing toward fixing that. <strong>Here are some of the things that are in the pipeline:</strong></p>

<h3>A. A custom CMS designed for churches</h3>

<p>Airtable is great - but it’s not our end game. We want to make a custom CMS designed from scratch for churches. We’ve already got a prototype in the works and it is going to be awesome!</p>

<h3>B. Custom iOS and Android apps for churches</h3>

<p>We want you to have your own app. Imagine telling your members they can skip the paper bulletin and just download the ^Name of your Church^ App on the App store or Google Play. Not only will this give your church members access to prayer requests, sermons, events, etc. on their phones - it will also allow you to easily send notifications to most of the people in your church.</p>

<h3>C. Bulletins and Prayer Sheets</h3>

<p>As part of our eventual CMS - we are going to provide an easy way to make printable prayer sheets and bulletins. These will be simple and data-driven but will potentially save you tons of time. (Ryan’s church already does some bulletins this way.)</p>

<h3>D. Websites for missionaries</h3>

<p>Eventually, we want to offer websites for missionaries as well. This is something we already have a lot of experience in. Missionary websites would be even cheaper than church websites (we aren’t interested in ANY profit from missionaries). For missionary websites - we plan to find and use national pastors (who have tech skills) as site-reps. We are already looking for these men and working on missionary themes.</p>
