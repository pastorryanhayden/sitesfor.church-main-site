                <p>We assign you a “site-rep” (usually a Bible college student or another minister) who will setup your site for you and help you learn how to use it.  <strong>If you have an existing site, they will help you transfer it.</strong>  This person will also be your primary support person.  <em>They won’t enter your content for you week to week, but they’ll be there to help with everything else.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Most churches in America have less than 200 members and financial pressures.</strong> They can't afford to make a car payment to a website company every week.  <em><strong>Google our competitors.</strong></em>  $1500 a year for a church website is just not reasonable for most churches.</p>
      <p>Sitesfor.Church costs $30 a month with a one year commitment.  No setup fees.  No tricks.  Our small church spends nearly that much on coffee.</p>
