                <h3>A site this week. <span>(Powerful starting points.)</span></h3>
                <p>Our sites aren't just templates - they are powerful starting points with boilerplates for everything that a real church needs on a website. Stuff like a special page with info for visitors, a page about your pastor, a page with your beliefs, pages for your ministries and much more. These pages are already there and they look great - all you need to do is change the details.  Everything should just work out of the box.  Because who has time to set up a website?</p>

                <p>We've spent decades building websites and we've tried just about every system out there.  Most of them are confusing at best and downright scary at worst.  <strong>We set out to make a system so easy and obvious, that any volunteer can figure it out.</strong>  Testing it, we heard things like <em>"this is so much easier than anything I've used before"</em> and <em>"that's pretty obvious."</em> We think youâ€™ll agree.</p>

      <p><strong>Most churches in America have less than 200 members and financial pressures.</strong> They can't afford to make a car payment to a website company every week.  <em><strong>Google our competitors.</strong></em>  $1500 a year for a church website is just not reasonable for most churches.</p>
      <p>Sitesfor.Church costs $30 a month with a one year commitment.  No setup fees.  No tricks.  Our small church spends nearly that much on coffee.</p>
