# Working With Events

Your church probably has many church-wide and ministry events (like Vacation Bible School, special speakers, youth group activities, etc.).  If it's anything like mine, promoting and organizing those events is a constant challenge.

The events module is tied in with our ministries module to make it easy to display and promote events. Events will be displayed prominantly on:

* Your home page.
* Your calendar page.
* Your individual ministry pages.


!!! Note
    There are a couple of Events only fields you should be aware of:

### DateTime

This field is the date of the event, NOT the date that the event was posted.  This is important because our system uses this to filter events.

### featured_image

This needs to be a 16x9 (widescreen) image.  I would highly recommend that you use [canva](http://canva.com) or another tool to create images for the things you want to promote.  Because these are a standard size you can use them in your promotion slides.

### Ministry

This field allows you to link a ministry (or ministries.)  Doing this will show this event on the individual ministry page.
