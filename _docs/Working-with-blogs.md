Blogs on sitesfor.church are pretty straightforward.  To begin with, you'll want to add an author to the authors tab.  Then work across the grid (or down the form) adding the appropriate content.  Remember that the "body_content" needs to be in Markdown and the "featured_image" needs to be a 16x9 (widescreen) image.
