Doubtless, your church has many sub-group ministries like:

* a youth group
* a choir
* a radio program
* a mom's group
* etc.

Ministry pages are designed to give that subgroup a home on the web.  They are one page where members of that group can get contact information, recent photos, and upcoming group event details and where site visitors can find out about the ministries of your church.  Ministries are integrated both into the events and the photos section of the site.

To setup a ministry page, simply fill out the information in the Airtable form.  

!!! Note
    There are a couple of Ministry only fields you should be aware of:

### Show_on_home_page

Some of our themes feature ministries on the home page.  If you are using one of those themes, this checkbox will let you determine which ministries you want featured.

### Exclude from menus

For the purpose of organizing your events and photos, you may want there to be some ministry options that you don't necessarily want a page for.  (Such as a church-wide option.)  This check box allows you to setup ministries that aren't available in the menu.

### Group

The "group" field is intended to show the subgroup this ministry caters too.  So, for example, our church's "Classic Christians" ministry caters to "Senior Citizens" and our "Youth Group" is for "Middle and High School Students."

### Leader Information

You may want to provide basic information about who is leading this ministry.  That is what the "leader" tab is for.  The reason it is separated into it's own tab is so that you can easily reuse leaders without haveing to re-enter their information every time.
