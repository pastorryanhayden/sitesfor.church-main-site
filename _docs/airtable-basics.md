# Managing your site with Airtable

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbtiY_Lbyos" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br>

The main place where your website will be managed is in Airtable.  You can access [Airtable.com](http://airtable.com).  

**You'll be receiving an invite to Airtable via email and can start updating it immediately.** 

Once you are in Airtable, you'll notice several "bases" these are where your site will be managed.

## I. Sharing Access

One of the chief advantages of Airtable is it's sharing features. You can easily give access to collaborators to either your whole website or just one section of it. There are two ways to share access to site:

### 1. Team Access

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/team-access.png) 

To share access to all of your website bases, you can grant "team access."  Click the green "share" button over your bases.  This will open a window where you can grant team access by just adding people's email addresses.



### 2. Base Access

If you only want to share access to one part of the site (like giving access to your only your sermons to the church sound guy) you can grant base access.  To grant base access, click on the little downward facing arrow under a base icon, then click the "sharing" option.  This will open a similar menu to the base access menu shown above where you can grant access to a contributor via email.

## II. Adding Content (The Basics)

### The Double Arrow is your friend.

Once you've clicked on the base you want to add too (i.e. Sermons) you can add content just as you would in a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.  But you'll probably want to use the form view.  You can access the form view by click on the little double arrow icon at the beginning of the row.

That will open the form view you can see here:

### Mind the dots.

Airtable doesn't let us integrate other products (like Classeur or Canva) into the form view yet, but we can add links at the top of the rows in the grid view.  Anytime you see a dot next to the file name, hovering over it will give you access to a helpful link.

## III. Deleting Content

<br>

It's very easy to delete content, but the process is slightly different depending on whether you are in grid view or form view.

### In Grid View

When you hover over the number at the far left of the grid view, it turns into a checkbox.  

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/checkbox.png)

You can check as many rows as you want and then right click and select "delete selected records."

### In Form View

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/delete-record.png)

You can delete individual records in form view.  Simple click on the small downward facing arrow next to the name at the top and select "Delete Record."

## IV. Updating Content (Temporary)

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/updated-at.png)

Currently, when you update a record, you must click the "Updated_At" field, then the today button.  This allows our system to know that the content has been updated recently so that we can rebuild your site and upload the changes.

Airtable has assured us that this will be unnecessary very soon. 

## V. Content Collection and Contact Responses

<br>

The standard bases that come with a sitesfor.church site are:

* Sermons
* About Pages
* Blog
* Ministries
* Content Collection
* Contact Responses


![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/main%20bases.png)

**Only four of these bases update content on your website. ** They are Sermons, About Pages, Blog and Ministries.  There are whole pages in the documentation dedicated to each one of these.

The other two: **Content Collection and Contact Responses** have different purposes...

### Content Collection

The sole purpose of the content collection base is to serve as a place to communicate with your site-rep during the setup process.  In it you can upload content and files as well as communicate with your site rep about what you need from each other.  **None of the stuff on this base will not find it's way onto the live site unless the site-rep puts it there.**


### Contact Responses

When a visitor to your site uses the contact form, you'll receive an email and the response will be recorded in the "contact responses table." This table just serves as a backup or alternate viewing place for for comments you received through the contact form.
