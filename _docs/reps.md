# III. The Fourth Tool: Your Site Rep

The site rep is the person responsible for: 

* making sure your site gets set up to your liking.
* helping you and your volunteers get comfortable using it.
* being your primary contact for support or help.

You should get a phone call from a site-rep within 24 hours after signing up for sitesfor.church, they'll setup a time for a longer phone call and begin working on your getting your site ready.
