# Working With Sermons

If you are like most churches, the one thing that will get updated most often will be the sermon section.  *We are really proud of the sermon solution that we've built and we think it's easier than anything else out there.*  Here are the steps to setting it up and using it.

!!! note
    Sermons will not work unless speakers and series are added first.

## I. Setup the Speakers

The first step to setting up sermons is setting up the speakers.  This will probably not have to be done very often.  The only thing to keep in mind here is that **the thumbnail needs to be a square image**.


## II. Adding Series

Series play a big role in our sermon management system.  Adding series is pretty self-explanatory.  One key part of the series is the "featured_image." The featured image must be a 16x9(widescreen) image.

Adding sermons is done the same way Series that you add series.  This time, choose the "sermons" tab of the "sermons" base and then work through the grid or through the form adding various content.  

Bear in mind that the "body_content" field needs to be **Markdown** format.  If you need help writing markdown, we highly suggest the free web app [Classeur.](https://app.classeur.io/#!/)
