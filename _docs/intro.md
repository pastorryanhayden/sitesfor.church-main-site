# Introduction: We Make Weird Websites!

Nothing about Sitesfor.Church is normal:  

* Our founder is a pastor.  
* Our team members live all across the world.  
* Our main office is in a garage.  
* We are more interested in helping small churches than we are in making money. 

...The list goes on and on.

**But it's not just us that are weird - our websites are weird too.** While we might just be *"weird weird"*, our sites are *"awesome weird."*  We may do things differently, but we do them differently for very good reasons.  

The biggest single difference between your website and 99% of the websites out there is that it is **static.**

# I. Weird Sites: Static Sites

We are sorry to bore you with this technical mumbo-jumbo but **it's important for you to understand one thing about your website**: 

> 99% of websites are **programs**, your website is just **static files**.

Now, this doesn't mean that your website isn't easy to update - you'll find it EASIER to update than almost anything out there.  It also doesn't mean that you can't do amazing things - you can.  It just means that your data, your website, and the program putting it together are all on different computers.

## First, the bad news.

The only downside to this approach is **time**.  Whereas on most websites, your updates happen *immediately*, on our system you have to wait until a script runs before you see changes to your site.  This should never take more than thirty minutes.

Now, onto...

## Lots of Good News

### Your website will be really fast.

Because your website is just a bunch of flat files, the server doesn't have to do anything when a user requests a page.  Translation - it's going to seem like it's flying.  People might not know what's different about your site but they will notice something.

### Your website will be really secure.

No program running on a server means no program to hack.  Believe me, as someone who has gone through the pain of having a wordpress site hacked more than once, this is a really good thing.  Without access to the server credentials (and I'm not giving them away) it's impossible for your site to be hacked.

### Your website won't break.

Because there is nothing on the server besides a bunch of files - there is nothing to break on your website.  If something ever goes wrong, it happens during the build process and your live site isn't effected.


### Hosting for your website is cheaper.

One of the reasons our prices can be so low is because static sites aren't just better - they allow us to save money on hosting costs.  Static sites mean more money is going to the site-rep and less money is going into infrastructure.

## Are you the only guys doing static sites?

**Heavens no!**  For the reasons above, static sites are getting more and more popular.  Many companies large companies run huge parts of their sites this way including:

* Nest
* Google
* Mailchimp
* Vox media
* Netflix (their blog and documentation)
* many, many more.

# II. Weird Tools: Airtable, Markdown, Image Editing 

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/chefs%20knife.png)

In my kitchen I have a drawer full of single use kitchen gadgets that I almost never use.  Someone taught me early on that if you know how to use a chef's knife, you don't need 90% of those kitchen gadgets.  At sitesfor.church we try to use "chef's knife" tools.  Their may be a slight learning curve (we'll help you) but the benefits are awesome.

## Tool 1: Airtable

Airtable is a fantastic web app that you will use to manage your website.  It has great features like drag and drop file uploading, sharing, backups and real-time collaboration that would be almost impossible to build into a church website.  It also has great native iOS and Android apps so you can update your website with the computer in your pocket.  We think you'll love it.

You can use Airtable for all kinds of stuff beyond your church website.  At Bible Baptist Church (Ryan's church) we use it for event sign ups, prayer requests, attendance tracking, reimbursements, and planning special music.  It's an incredibly powerful tool that's ridiculously easy to use.

## Tool 2: Markdown

Markdown is a plain text writing syntax.  In other words, it's not a program, it's a bunch of rules for writing text.  You can learn the basics of Markdown in less than 10 minutes.  

Sitesfor.church uses markdown for all of our text content.  Any field in Airtable where you would put long content you can enter Markdown.

(Check out the intro to Markdown below:)

<br>

You can write markdown anywhere (including right in Airtable), but while you are learning we recommend a free web app called [Classeur](http://classeur.io).   We make sure that near all of our text content fields there is a link to Classeur.

At Bible Baptist, all of our sermons, sermon handouts, and even slides are written using markdown.  It's a pretty amazing system that saves us hours  of time.

Besides Classeur, here are some other Markdowns tools we recommend.  They are of varying quality and price.  (We will let you know our favorite from each group.):

#### For Windows:

* [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) (Our favorite.)

#### For the Mac:

There are DOZENS of Mac markdown tools. We've narrowed it down to these tools for Mac that are really, really, good.

## Tool 3: Image Editing

The last tool is image editing.  Good looking images are the heart of any great web design and we've found that the most common pain point for websites is adding images.  To help with that, we do four things:

### A. Keep it simple. (Just two image sizes)

#### i. Featured Images

![](http://placehold.it/350x197/F48366/fff?text=16x9)

Any time a field has the term “featured image” in it’s name we are looking for a very specific kind of image. We are looking for an image with a 16x9 aspect ratio. Common 16x9 sizes include 1920x1080 (1080p) and 1280x720 (720p). Images that are this size are the same sizes of standard television screens and are the most common format for slide images.

#### ii. Thumbnails

![](http://placehold.it/200x200/F48366/fff?text=1x1)

Any time you see the term thumbnail in a field’s title what we are looking for is a square image. At a minimum, we suggest an image that is at least 150x150 pixels. Thumbnails are almost always pictures of people, and one easy way to get thumbnail images is to reuse twitter or Facebook avatars.

### B. Defaults and fallbacks

Images are an important part of any web design and when your site uses current images - it will really come alive. But if you choose not to upload a custom featured image for a blog post, sermon series or event - we’ve got you covered. Each theme comes with appropriate default images that will display when you don’t want to create your own.

### C. Canva.com links

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47159282/canva.png)

When you do want to create your own, we highly suggest a service called [Canva.com](http://canva.com). Canva.com is a webapp that makes it super easy to create great looking images. It’s completely free to use unless you decide to use one of their stock images (which are very affordably priced.) Simply open canva and choose the “Presentation (16:9)” template. Customize it to your liking and then click the download button.

### D. Lots of tutorials

On our [blog](http://www.sitesfor.church/blog-list.html) there will be a lot of tutorials including tutorials on how to best use canva and another tool we recommend: [affinity designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/).
