## What you'll be getting from us:

When you [sign-up](#) for Sitesfor.church, you will get three things from us:

#### 1. A welcome email.

You'll receive an email from us.  Basically, it will contain the same things you'll find on this page.


#### 2. An email from airtable.

You'll receive an email from a company called [Airtable](http://airtable.com) requesting for you to collaborate on a team.  We need you to click the link on this email.  **Airtable is the tool that you'll be using to update your website.** 

#### 3. A call from the site-rep.

You will be getting a call from a person we call a "site-rep."  The site-rep will be the person responsible for setting up your website and your go-to person for support.  The site-rep will schedule a second phone call where they can help you get comfortable with the site.

## What we need from you:

#### 1. Start learning markdown.

<br>

You have to know markdown to edit the information on the site.  Please take ten minutes to watch the video above and please start using Markdown today.  We think markdown is easy, but even still, it's the biggest technical thing we are going to ask you to learn.  We promise that if you take a few minutes to learn this, everything else will come easy.  

!!! warning
    This is very important.  If you don't take the time to learn Markdown, you are going to have a very hard time with this.  If you do - it will be awesome.


#### 2. Sign up for Airtable and start adding content.

Their is one "base" called "Content_Collection" - this is yours to mess with as much as you want and will be the primary place that you and your site-rep share files and information about setting up your site. 

#### 3. Look over our documentation.

**You are here!**  Continue to read through the information and watch the videos on this page.  It will tell you everything you need to know about updating your website.
