Weird Sites: Static Sites\n#\n\n\nWe are sorry to bore you with this technical mumbo-jumbo but \nit's important for you to understand one thing about your website\n: \n\n\n\n\n99% of websites are \nprograms\n, your website is just \nstatic files\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow, this doesn't mean that your website isn't easy to update - you'll find it EASIER to update than almost anything out there.  It also doesn't mean that you can't do amazing things - you can.  It just means that your data, your website, and the program putting it together are all on different computers.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the bad news.\n#\n\n\nThe only downside to this approach is \ntime\n.  Whereas on most websites, your updates happen \nimmediately\n, on our system you have to wait until a script runs before you see changes to your site.  This should never take more than thirty minutes.\n\n\nNow, onto...\n\n\n\n\nLots of Good News\n#\n\n\nYour website will be really fast.\n#\n\n\nBecause your website is just a bunch of flat files, the server doesn't have to do anything when a user requests a page.  Translation - it's going to seem like it's flying.  People might not know what's different about your site but they will notice something.\n\n\nYour website will be really secure.\n#\n\n\nNo program running on a server means no program to hack.  Believe me, as someone who has gone through the pain of having a wordpress site hacked more than once, this is a really good thing.  Without access to the server credentials (and I'm not giving them away) it's impossible for your site to be hacked.\n\n\nYour website won't break.\n#\n\n\nBecause there is nothing on the server besides a bunch of files - there is nothing to break on your website.  If something ever goes wrong, it happens during the build process and your live site isn't effected.\n\n\nHosting for your website is cheaper.\n#\n\n\nOne of the reasons our prices can be so low is because static sites aren't just better - they allow us to save money on hosting costs.  Static sites mean more money is going to the site-rep and less money is going into infrastructure.\n\n\nAre you the only guys doing static sites?\n#\n\n\nHeavens no!\n  For the reasons above, static sites are getting more and more popular.  Many companies large companies run huge parts of their sites this way including:\n\n\n\n\nNest\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nMailchimp\n\n\nVox media\n\n\nNetflix (their blog and documentation)\n\n\nmany, many more.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a geek at heart and care to learn more about this trend, you can read a \ngreat write-up about it here\n.\n\n\nII. Weird Tools: Airtable, Markdown, Image Editing\n#\n\n\n\n\nIn my kitchen I have a drawer full of single use kitchen gadgets that I almost never use.  Someone taught me early on that if you know how to use a chef's knife, you don't need 90% of those kitchen gadgets.  At sitesfor.church we try to use \"chef's knife\" tools.  Their may be a slight learning curve (we'll help you) but the benefits are awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool 1: Airtable\n#\n\n\nAirtable is a fantastic web app that you will use to manage your website.  It has great features like drag and drop file uploading, sharing, backups and real-time collaboration that would be almost impossible to build into a church website.  It also has great native iOS and Android apps so you can update your website with the computer in your pocket.  We think you'll love it.\n\n\nYou can use Airtable for all kinds of stuff beyond your church website.  At Bible Baptist Church (Ryan's church) we use it for event sign ups, prayer requests, attendance tracking, reimbursements, and planning special music.  It's an incredibly powerful tool that's ridiculously easy to use.\n\n\n\n\nTool 2: Markdown\n#\n\n\nMarkdown is a plain text writing syntax.  In other words, it's not a program, it's a bunch of rules for writing text.  You can learn the basics of Markdown in less than 10 minutes.  \n\n\nSitesfor.church uses markdown for all of our text content.  Any field in Airtable where you would put long content you can enter Markdown.\n\n\n(Check out the intro to Markdown below:)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can write markdown anywhere (including right in Airtable), but while you are learning we recommend a free web app called \nClasseur\n.   We make sure that near all of our text content fields there is a link to Classeur.\n\n\nAt Bible Baptist, all of our sermons, sermon handouts, and even slides are written using markdown.  It's a pretty amazing system that saves us hours  of time.\n\n\nBesides Classeur, here are some other Markdowns tools we recommend.  They are of varying quality and price.  (We will let you know our favorite from each group.):\n\n\nFor Windows:\n#\n\n\n\n\nTypora\n (Our favorite.)\n\n\nMarkdownPad\n\n\nRemarkable\n\n\n\n\nFor the Mac:\n#\n\n\nThere are DOZENS of Mac markdown tools. We've narrowed it down to these tools for Mac that are really, really, good.\n\n\n\n\niA Writer\n (Our favorite.)\n\n\nUlysses\n\n\nByword\n\n\nWrite\n\n\nTypora\n\n\n\n\nFor iOS:\n#\n\n\n\n\niA Writer\n (Our favorite.)\n\n\nUlysses\n\n\nByword\n\n\nWrite\n\n\n\n\nFor Android:\n#\n\n\n\n\niA Writer\n (Our favorite.)\n\n\nJotterPad\n\n\nMarkdownX\n\n\n\n\nWeb based:\n#\n\n\n\n\nClasseur\n (Obviously our favorite.)\n\n\nMarkable\n\n\nDillinger\n\n\nStackedit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool 3: Image Editing\n#\n\n\nThe last tool is image editing.  Good looking images are the heart of any great web design and we've found that the most common pain point for websites is adding images.  To help with that, we do four things:\n\n\nA. Keep it simple. (Just two image sizes)\n#\n\n\ni. Featured Images\n#\n\n\n\n\nAny time a field has the term \u201cfeatured image\u201d in it\u2019s name we are looking for a very specific kind of image. We are looking for an image with a 16x9 aspect ratio. Common 16x9 sizes include 1920x1080 (1080p) and 1280x720 (720p). Images that are this size are the same sizes of standard television screens and are the most common format for slide images.\n\n\nii. Thumbnails\n#\n\n\n\n\nAny time you see the term thumbnail in a field\u2019s title what we are looking for is a square image. At a minimum, we suggest an image that is at least 150x150 pixels. Thumbnails are almost always pictures of people, and one easy way to get thumbnail images is to reuse twitter or Facebook avatars.\n\n\nB. Defaults and fallbacks\n#\n\n\nImages are an important part of any web design and when your site uses current images - it will really come alive. But if you choose not to upload a custom featured image for a blog post, sermon series or event - we\u2019ve got you covered. Each theme comes with appropriate default images that will display when you don\u2019t want to create your own.\n\n\nC. Canva.com links\n#\n\n\n\n\nWhen you do want to create your own, we highly suggest a service called \nCanva.com\n. Canva.com is a webapp that makes it super easy to create great looking images. It\u2019s completely free to use unless you decide to use one of their stock images (which are very affordably priced.) Simply open canva and choose the \u201cPresentation (16:9)\u201d template. Customize it to your liking and then click the download button.\n\n\nD. Lots of tutorials\n#\n\n\nOn our \nblog\n there will be a lot of tutorials including tutorials on how to best use canva and another tool we recommend: \naffinity designer\n.",

You can access \nAirtable.com\n.  \n\n\nYou'll be receiving an invite to Airtable via email and can start updating it immediately.\n \n\n\nOnce you are in Airtable, you'll notice several \"bases\" these are where your site will be managed. \n\n\n\n\nI. Sharing Access\n#\n\n\n\n\nOne of the chief advantages of Airtable is it's sharing features. You can easily give access to collaborators to either your whole website or just one section of it. There are two ways to share access to site:\n\n\n1. Team Access\n#\n\n\n \n\n\nTo share access to all of your website bases, you can grant \"team access.\"  Click the green \"share\" button over your bases.  This will open a window where you can grant team access by just adding people's email addresses.\n\n\n2. Base Access\n#\n\n\n\n\nIf you only want to share access to one part of the site (like giving access to your only your sermons to the church sound guy) you can grant base access.  To grant base access, click on the little downward facing arrow under a base icon, then click the \"sharing\" option.  This will open a similar menu to the base access menu shown above where you can grant access to a contributor via email.\n\n\nII. Adding Content (The Basics)\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Double Arrow is your friend.\n#\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've clicked on the base you want to add too (i.e. Sermons) you can add content just as you would in a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.  But you'll probably want to use the form view.  You can access the form view by click on the little double arrow icon at the beginning of the row.\n\n\nThat will open the form view you can see here:\n\n\n\n\nMind the dots.\n#\n\n\n\n\nAirtable doesn't let us integrate other products (like Classeur or Canva) into the form view yet, but we can add links at the top of the rows in the grid view.  Anytime you see a dot next to the file name, hovering over it will give you access to a helpful link.\n\n\nIII. Deleting Content\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's very easy to delete content, but the process is slightly different depending on whether you are in grid view or form view.\n\n\nIn Grid View\n#\n\n\nWhen you hover over the number at the far left of the grid view, it turns into a checkbox.  \n\n\n\n\nYou can check as many rows as you want and then right click and select \"delete selected records.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn Form View\n#\n\n\n\n\nYou can delete individual records in form view.  Simple click on the small downward facing arrow next to the name at the top and select \"Delete Record.\"\n\n\nIV. Updating Content (Temporary)\n#\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, when you update a record, you must click the \"Updated_At\" field, then the today button.  This allows our system to know that the content has been updated recently so that we can rebuild your site and upload the changes.\n\n\nAirtable has assured us that this will be unnecessary very soon. \n\n\nV. Content Collection and Contact Responses\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard bases that come with a sitesfor.church site are:\n\n\n\n\nSermons\n\n\nAbout Pages\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nMinistries\n\n\nContent Collection\n\n\nContact Responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly four of these bases update content on your website. \n They are Sermons, About Pages, Blog and Ministries.  There are whole pages in the documentation dedicated to each one of these.\n\n\nThe other two: \nContent Collection and Contact Responses\n have different purposes...\n\n\n\n\nContent Collection\n#\n\n\nThe sole purpose of the content collection base is to serve as a place to communicate with your site-rep during the setup process.  In it you can upload content and files as well as communicate with your site rep about what you need from each other.  \nNone of the stuff on this base will not find it's way onto the live site unless the site-rep puts it there.\n\n\nContact Responses\n#\n\n\nWhen a visitor to your site uses the contact form, you'll receive an email and the response will be recorded in the \"contact responses table.\" This table just serves as a backup or alternate viewing place for for comments you received through the contact form.",
