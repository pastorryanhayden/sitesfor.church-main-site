[Prochurch.com](http://prochurch.com/prochurchcms/church-graphics-solution.html) is a great product.  They have ridiculously talented graphic designers (far better than me) who make beautiful and very practical stuff.  I have been doing graphic design for over a decade and I have paid to use their designs more than once.

For a flat monthly fee, you can access and edit all of their designs.  Again - these are top notch.  If you don’t feel like you are graphically talented, or (like me) you just want to make use of their very talented designers.  This is, in my opinion, a worthwhile investment for your church.

One thing I’m super excited about is some free resources they are now offering in the form of several websites:

* [Churchhacks.co](http://www.churchhacks.co/) - Lots of neat technology tips for your church.
* [Freechurchphotos.co](http://www.freechurchphotos.co/) - Beautiful photos you can use in your church (or on your website).
* [Freechurchlogos.co](http://www.freechurchlogos.co/) - Fantastic free church logos you can download and reuse.
* [Freechurchgraphics.co](http://www.freechurchgraphics.co/) - Great graphics you can download and edit.
* [Freechurchvideos.co](http://www.freechurchvideos.co/) - Free short videos you can use in your church.

These are FANTASTIC resources.  I’m especially excited about the logos and graphics.  I’ll probably be using both many, many times.

Even though the team at prochurch are competitors (they also sell websites) they are good guys serving the Lord and their graphics services (as well as their websites) are well worth a look.  If you haven’t checked them out yet - you should.

(Thank you to my friend [Bryan Ries](https://twitter.com/BryanLRies) and the [Ministry Connection Podcast](http://www.ministryconnectionpodcast.com/072-allen-taylor-prochurch/) for bringing this to my attention.)
