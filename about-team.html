              <h4>Our process is weird <em>(and we are proud of it.)</em></h4>
              <p>Our sites are built using static build tools so they fly and never break.  We use Airtable, an online database app for managing content.  This makes it so easy to update them (and add new content types) you'll wonder why you ever used traditional CMS products.</p>
